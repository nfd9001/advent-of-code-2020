My Advent Of Code solutions in 2020

My solutions are going to be semi-casual; haven't prepped a special kit this year or what-have-you.
You may see some tpyoes or ugly lines here or there or less-then-clever code,
and I'm probably not going to beautify these solutions up much.

Uses: 
* split-0.2.3.4
* matrix-0.3.6.1
