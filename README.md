My Advent Of Code solutions in 2020

My solutions are going to be semi-casual; haven't prepped a special kit this year or what-have-you.
You may see some tpyoes or ugly lines here or there or less-then-clever code,
and I'm probably not going to beautify these solutions up much.

#Note
If these solutions crash on my inputs on my machine, the issue probably
has to do with differing line endings, as I switched between a couple
different machines for different days. Just run `dos2unix` or similar
on the input files to fix this. At the end of the challenge, I will
make sure to unify the line ending formats, but I won't check this every day
during the rest of the challenge.

Uses: 
* split-0.2.3.4
* matrix-0.3.6.1
* megaparsec
* parser-combinators
* containers
